I believe it would be a better idea than bombarding your phone, assuming you're going to read it all. I'll try to keep this focused, even though it's freeform.

I'll start by addressing that, as it was the first time I sensed something was amiss. Why? I couldn't comprehend the reason; it made no sense. Yes, frequency is the fastest and best way to refine form. However, relying solely on frequency and overloading is not a path to perfecting form; it's a method for reaching peak strength. Pushing endurance in this manner can lead to burning out your central nervous system (CNS). Burning out your CNS without adequate recovery can result in gastrointestinal (GI) tract distress (your CNS, Immune System are interconnected here with your GI). This distress, in turn, brings about changes in your Endocrine system. The disruption here prompts the release of Cortisol by your adrenal gland, known as the stress hormone. Cortisol levels are elevated in individuals experiencing both heightened emotional stress and higher percentages of body fat. The main takeaway from this article below is as follows...

Activation or suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is associated with alterations in body composition.

To summarize the "Abstract" section...

When we talk about the body and how it deals with stress and food an important player here is cortisol, which goes up when we're stressed. Now, some people have more cortisol when they're stressed, and it turns out those people are more likely to gain weight and become overweight.

Some have a lot of cortisol when they're stressed ("high-cortisol responders"), and tend to eat more when they're stressed. They also have some differences in their bodies that make them more likely to gain weight. On the other hand, people that have less cortisol during stress (we'll call them "low-cortisol responders"), and they eat less in stressful situations.

So, what does all this mean? If this is happening, and you're maintaining the same diet as you mentioned on Saturday, while experiencing increased stress during workouts and in your life outside the gym, your body will start to chemically shut down and produce even more cortisol, leading to an accumulation of body fat. Additionally, the throttling back of your central nervous system (CNS) makes you weaker. You're now caught in a vicious cycle until you either reach a mental breaking point, find yourself in the hospital, potentially quitting all forms of fitness or contemplate even worse outcomes.

I know this personally. I made the same mistakes early on when I started to get sick, long before anyone had any idea I was dying. Years ago, I weighed 270 lbs, but I didn't look like I do in the picture I showed you. Why? Because I wasn't in a healthy state. I spent a year not only pushing myself to the limit but also enduring my body reacting to something killing me. Yes there are other factors involved, but the tendency is for people to push harder, or quit.

"There are numerous reasons to exercise caution when engaging in high-impact activities like running. Before going further, if running is therapeutic to you, then you need to run. It might require sacrificing something else in return, but such a compromise is not a negative, especially if it contributes to your mental and emotional well-being.

However, as mentioned earlier, there is a correlation that demands respect. If you're engaging in a high intensity workout Monday in the gym, running (high intensity) Tuesday, another high intensity workout in the gym Wednesday, running (high intensity) Thursday, more training in gym Friday, even more Saturday, running again on Sunday, and so forth, the question arises: where is the recovery? The answer, rhetorically put, is that there is none. The fact that you've sustained this routine for many months is remarkable, albeit awful. Without a doubt proof of your mental and emotional resilience. Nevertheless, it's only a matter of time before your body reaches its limit, undergoing hormonal changes that can lead to a mental and emotional tailspin. Furthermore, the cumulative strain on your body, despite the time and effort invested, may impede the results you're striving for. Kim herself shut herself down, but then again she has external factors at play to make her predicament worse.

The results, or the lack thereof, as you expressed last Saturday, are disheartening. You have every right to be upset and frustrated. Although Bob doesn't know the entire story, there was truth in me telling him how he fried me at the last meet. I see it happening again with you. A year ago, when I 'fired' him, it wasn't all his fault, but he was neglecting my wishes and goals. His incompetence then is evident for the same reasons nowâ€”he's taking on too much, not accepting realities, and essentially ignoring situational awareness. Additionally, he is incredibly stubborn and remains steadfast in old ways. While those methods aren't necessarily wrong, they have been improved upon, improvements he does not embrace. Plus, good luck getting him to admit he is wrong.

I was taught by this man...

Bobby Moegle, the most successful baseball coach of all time at any level (at the time I knew him), also happened to be my weightlifting coach (high school). Born in 1933, he predates Bob's generation (born in 1948) and has been teaching weightlifting since the late 50s. Moegle opposed any form of chemical enhancement. The chemical trend in powerlifting he considers an abomination (Moegle). Despite his age, he's still alive.

I consider myself a mutable person. I find that being comfortable is uncomfortable, to be complacent. I enjoy being challenged and welcome corrections when it's supported by truth. I have an aversion to hindering growth, especially in terms of learning. This is largely why I believe my knowledge has forked from Bob's. I utilize machine learning (ML), processing datasets, handling large language models (LLM), and compiling as well as comprehending structured data. My approach involves merging traditional methods with modern techniques, sciences, and so on, to encompass all knowledge. To me, that is the future. I don't adhere to bro lifting, bro science, or clinging stubbornly to patterns and histories.

Anyhow, getting back to the point of all this...

This sound familiar? That I do this also for therapeutic reasons. That your last competition meet you did, you did more, just like I did more, on my own. I showed you in the past what I do on non SBD days, and its "fluff" according to powerlifters. Well, "fluff" got me to doing pull-ups, leg ups, and other functional strength things I used to do, that I couldn't for a long time. I can't spring anymore, and I don't consider what I can do running, but its still jogging, and its more than me taking 500 or so steps like I was after surgeries, and having to learn how to walk again, for now the 3rd time.

Whether you choose to reveal things or not, I understand. I hope you're not embarrassed to share them. I don't find you to be one to be open about a lot of things at all. I'm not entirely sure about your perspective, although you've mentioned a bit about your body. This is why I showed you what I used to look like, and you're aware of what I look like now. At that time, I felt like a fat piece of shit. If I wasn't with someone at that time I would not expect anyone to want me at least on the surface. That person didn't want me either, just wanted my wallet, an I enabled it. Despite being athletic, I let myself go for various reasons. Undoing the damage from that period is still an ongoing process for me today. Despite what I look like now, I still have this belief that once someone knows my health, they won't want me either. That, an I told myself to just cut off the world and make no close connections, because I don't want to burden anyone with my life. I didn't want you to see me upset that day for a lot of reasons, and those are also some more of those reasons. I just simply don't want to hurt anyone. Its bad enough I have to suffer myself.

You deserve so much better than this. Having your needs addressed. Working within them. Your goals. I even confronted Bob/Kim a while back, getting Kim worked up, because we had to wait so long between sets. I hate doing that myself. They have a routine, which is fine, but it doesn't work for us. I might mouth off, talk trash, poke fun at you, be a smartass, flirt, or whatever, but I wouldn't let you come near my barbell and work with me if I didn't think you could keep up, work together as a team, and not detract from my purpose being there. Initially, you did irritate me by doing these things, but it's because it irritates me in public gyms when people behave this way. The first thing that crosses my mind is 'Why does she want my attention?' and 'I'm not here for picking up numbers and booty calls' because that's become the norm and culture in public gyms now like a bar. However, you made it very clear quickly that you're friendly and willing to work on my terms. You demonstrated that our goals align in the gym.

Don't buy into that your body looks like shit. Your being very hard on yourself, and if its that, or apathy, better to be a hard ass than apathetic. But you do not look like shit at all, not one bit. If someone told you that they need to eat shit and die. If you told yourself that, then its time that you learn to love the skin you are in, somehow, and some way. Yes I am guilty of that way of thinking, but no one will love you if you don't love yourself, first. Pitfall I fell in much of my time being sick, is thinking these things and hating myself.

I want to help you. I don't want your money. I don't want anything except to help you because it's going to take a little more than programming and gym time. I discussed other topics to come full circle to it here. If you're that upset about your body, its appearance, and you think that following routines and doing what you used to do will work, you'll likely find some success for a bit, but eventually, you'll hit another wall. That's my concern - that you'll hit that wall, and then what? I can explain more about those things, but it's futile to go into depth right now if I can't convince you to trust me, let me try to help you, and understand that my interest is to see you get 'right' from the inside so you can commit to somewhat challenging things ahead.

I used to help train a friend of mine from high school at Crunch. Military mom. She does Spartan races. I already know you're going to hate life, going in after work, trying to get in and out when everyone else will be there, and sitting around for long periods, or finding something else to do, when you need to focus on what you set to do. I understand you won't be able to do it during the day when it's slow, and waking up early and doing that before work, like many people do, is a great way for those individuals to fail in various ways. I'm not trying to argue on that point, but I believe you will find yourself back in a place you don't want to be eventually, in my opinion.

If you want to do other things, like bodybuilding splits or HIIT, that's fine. However, it circles back to my point aboveâ€”you can't out-train your lifestyle or the factors and variables that happen outside of the gym. There is a saying: 'Abs are made in the kitchen,' followed by 'A six-pack will ruin your life,' and they are very true. Even if you accomplish those goals, if you don't approach them correctly, you will be as miserable now as you will be then. I'm not saying you live a poor lifestyle, but there are conditions that have to be met. It's a lot to take in, learn, adapt to, and be consistent with. I know you can do these things or I wouldn't waste my time here, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. I've been there, done that because I could and because I had no one else to help me. That's the worst way to learn.

As for gaining weight non-stop since you came in the summer, you need to stop relying on the scale and focus on more meaningful metrics. Consider your clothes, your physique, use a tailor's tape, calipers for body fat, and place the scale at the end of a list of metrics to judge progress. It's the last thing on the list for a reason. It can play mind games and mess with your head. I feel bad that you see your body this way. I don't. I think you're amazing inside and out. You're not some naive Barbie doll; you have a brain and your very intelligent, and you're as tough as the next person who claims to be tough. Yes, there's room for improvement for everyone, but I wish you could see what I see. All the girls at the gym would envy and give anything to have your body, your ability to commit and push through, and your strength. On paper, where you can't see any of this, you're stellar like your resume. You're stronger than all the girls at the gym, and most the guys. I don't care about Kim because she's a walking chemistry set and requires that. You're more athletically gifted than the girls there and most boys, which is why I even let you do things like spotting, hand-offs, etc. You're the most complete, competent, awesome person at that gym and the most impressive person I have met in a very, very long time. I don't say that to put you on a pedestal. I mean that and hope that you will in time believe it.

I would mention more I have on my mind, but it could change based on a few questions. But I know I can help, and how to make this work. No strings attached. Just some time, trust, and communication.
